Instead of mutating the underlying module in order to record these instantiations in the locals signature table, we instead build wrapper around the underlying module containing the type instantiations, and at the end materialize this updated signature pool into a module. We also need the ability to quickly determine if an instantiation has already been created, and if so, at which index. So this also keeps a reverse lookup table of instantiation to SignatureIndex."]]});
