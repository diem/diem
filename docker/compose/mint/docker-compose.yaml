# This compose file supports running a faucet node that connects to the `validator-testnet`
# compose's json-rpc endpoint. This should be started after that compose has been started.
# The mint / faucet can be accessed at 127.0.0.1:8000
#
# Place the following files into the same directory:
# * mint.key (also known as the diem_root_key)
# * waypoint.txt
