# This compose file defines a single validator node test network. In addition, it offers the
# following facilities:
# * JSON-RPC endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
# * waypoint file at waypoint.txt in the same directory as this compose
# * genesis.blob at genesis.blob in the same directory as this compose
# * libra_root_key (mint.key) in the same directory as this compose
# * chain_id of 4 / TESTING
#
# Additional information:
# * If you use this compose for different Libra Networks, you will need remove the db volume first.
# * If you move this compose, you must recreate the empty waypoint.txt and genesis.blob otherwise
# the container will fail to start.
# * If you would like to use the current Libra version within this repository, execute the
# `build.sh` in `docker/validator` and change the image tag below to libra_e2e:latest
# * Images can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/libra/validator/tags, obtain the latest tag and
# update below.
