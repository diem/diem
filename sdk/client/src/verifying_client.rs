/// The `VerifyingClient` is a [Diem JSON-RPC client] that verifies Diem's
/// cryptographic proofs when it makes API calls.
///
/// ## Concurrency
///
/// When issuing multiple concurrent requests with the `VerifyingClient`, we guarantee:
///
/// 1. Each response batch is fulfilled and verified at a ledger version that
///    is greater than or equal to the current trusted version _at the time we
///    made the request batch_, though not necessarily the globally most
///    recent trusted ledger version.
///
/// 2. Requests made serially within a single thread of execution appear
///    strictly ordered, i.e., they were fulfilled and verified at
///    monotonically increasing ledger versions (`v1 <= v2 <= ...`).
///
/// Consequently, without any other effort, multiple concurrent requests may have
/// responses that appear inconsistent or out-of-order. For example, naively
/// making concurrent `get_account(..)` requests will (most likely) show accounts
/// at different ledger versions; even further, the first response you receive may
/// show a more recent ledger version than the second response.
///
/// To avoid this issue, users should pin a concurrent batch of requests to the
/// same ledger version if they want to avoid an inconsistent ledger view.
