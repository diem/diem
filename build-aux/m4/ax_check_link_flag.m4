# SYNOPSIS
#
#   AX_CHECK_LINK_FLAG(FLAG, [ACTION-SUCCESS], [ACTION-FAILURE], [EXTRA-FLAGS], [INPUT])
#
# DESCRIPTION
#
#   Check whether the given FLAG works with the linker or gives an error.
#   (Warnings, however, are ignored)
#
#   ACTION-SUCCESS/ACTION-FAILURE are shell commands to execute on
#   success/failure.
#
#   If EXTRA-FLAGS is defined, it is added to the linker's default flags
#   when the check is done.  The check is thus made with the flags: "LDFLAGS
#   EXTRA-FLAGS FLAG".  This can for example be used to force the linker to
#   issue an error when a bad flag is given.
#
#   INPUT gives an alternative input source to AC_LINK_IFELSE.
#
#   NOTE: Implementation based on AX_CFLAGS_GCC_OPTION. Please keep this
#   macro in sync with AX_CHECK_{PREPROC,COMPILE}_FLAG.
