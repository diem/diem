//! An implementation of HKDF, the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function for the
//! Libra project based on [RFC 5869](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5869).
//!
//! The key derivation function (KDF) is intended to support a wide range of applications and
//! requirements, and is conservative in its use of cryptographic hash functions. In particular,
//! this implementation is compatible with hash functions that output 256 bits or more, such as
//! SHA256, SHA3-256 and SHA512.
//!
//! HKDF follows the "extract-then-expand" paradigm, where the KDF logically consists of two
//! modules: the first stage takes the input keying material (the seed) and "extracts" from it a
//! fixed-length pseudorandom key, and then the second stage "expands" this key into several
//! additional pseudorandom keys (the output of the KDF). For convenience, a function that runs both
//! steps in a single call is provided. Note that along with an initial high-entropy seed, a user
//! can optionally provide salt and app-info byte-arrays for extra security guarantees and domain
//! separation.
//!
//! # Applications
//!
//! HKDF is intended for use in a wide variety of KDF applications (see [Key derivation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function)), including:
//! a) derivation of keys from an origin high-entropy master seed. This is the recommended approach
//! for generating keys in Libra, especially when a True Random Generator is not available.
//! b) derivation of session keys from a shared Diffie-Hellman value in a key-agreement protocol.
//! c) combining entropy from multiple sources of randomness, such as entropy collected
//! from system events, user's keystrokes, /dev/urandom etc. The combined seed can then be used to
//! generate cryptographic keys for account, network and transaction signing keys among the others.
//! d) hierarchical private key derivation, similarly to Bitcoin's BIP32 protocol for easier key
//! management.
//! e) hybrid key generation that combines a master seed with a PRNG output for extra security
//! guarantees against a master seed leak or low PRNG entropy.
//!
//! # Recommendations
//!
//! **Salt**
//! HKDF can operate with and without random 'salt'. The use of salt adds to the strength of HKDF,
//! ensuring independence between different uses of the hash function, supporting
//! "source-independent" extraction, and strengthening the HKDF use. The salt value should be a
//! random string of the same length as the hash output. A shorter or less random salt value can
//! still make a contribution to the security of the output key material. Salt values should be
//! independent of the input keying material. In particular, an application needs to make sure that
//! salt values are not chosen or manipulated by an attacker.
//!
//! *Application info*
//! Key expansion accepts an optional 'info' value to which the application assigns some meaning.
//! Its objective is to bind the derived key material to application- and context-specific
//! information.  For example, 'info' may contain a protocol number, algorithm identifier,
//! child key number (similarly to [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)), etc. The only technical requirement for 'info' is that
//! it be independent of the seed.
//!
//! **Which function to use: extract, expand or both?**
//! Unless absolutely sure of what they are doing, applications should use both steps — if only for
//! the sake of compatibility with the general case.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! Run HKDF extract-then-expand so as to return 64 bytes, using 'salt', 'seed' and 'info' as
//! inputs.
//! ```
//! use libra_crypto::hkdf::Hkdf;
//! use sha2::Sha256;
//!
//! // some bytes required for this example.
//! let raw_bytes = [2u8; 10];
//! // define salt
//! let salt = Some(&raw_bytes[0..4]);
//! // define seed - in production this is recommended to be a 32 bytes or longer random seed.
//! let seed = [3u8; 32];
//! // define application info
//! let info = Some(&raw_bytes[4..10]);
//!
//! // HKDF extract-then-expand 64-bytes output
//! let derived_bytes = Hkdf::<Sha256>::extract_then_expand(salt, &seed, info, 64);
//! assert_eq!(derived_bytes.unwrap().len(), 64)
//! ```
