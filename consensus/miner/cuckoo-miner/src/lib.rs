//! cuckoo-miner is a Rust wrapper around John Tromp's Cuckoo Miner
//! C implementations, intended primarily for use in the Grin MimbleWimble
//! blockhain development project. However, it is also suitable for use as
//! a standalone miner or by any other project needing to use the
//! cuckoo cycle proof of work. cuckoo-miner is plugin based, and provides
//! a high level interface to load and work with C mining implementations.
