Tuning the cuckoo GPU solver
============

Outputs will vary for cuckaroo and cuckatoo but to the extent that options are accepted, results will mostly still be applicable.

Running with option -s provides a synopsis of solver options:

SYNOPSIS
  cuda29 [-s] [-c] [-d device] [-E 0-2] [-h hexheader] [-m trims] [-n nonce] [-r range] [-U seedAblocks] [-u seedAthreads] [-v seedBthreads] [-w Trimthreads] [-y Tailthreads] [-Z recoverblocks] [-z recoverthreads]
DEFAULTS
  cuda29 -d 0 -E 0 -h "" -m 176 -n 0 -r 1 -U 4096 -u 256 -v 128 -w 512 -y 1024 -Z 1024 -z 1024

Let's look at each of these in turn.

-d device
------------
This option lets us select among multiple CUDA devices. Default is 0.
Besides a 1080 Ti as device 0, I also have a plain 1080 available:

    $ ./cuda29 -d 1 | head -1
    GeForce GTX 1080 with 8114MB @ 256 bits x 5005MHz

-h hexheader
------------
This allows specification of arbitrary headers. Default "".
The given string is padded with nul bytes to a fixed header length of 80 bytes.
For example,

    $ ./cuda29 -h "DEADBEEF" | head -2
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("Þ­??",0) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 176 trims, and 64 thread blocks.

    $ ./cuda29 -h "444541440A42454546" | head -3
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("DEAD
    BEEF",0) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 176 trims, and 64 thread blocks.

    0 total solutions

-E edge expand round
------------
round before which edges are expanded into explicit endpoints, taking 8 bytes each
Higher values (1 and 2) result in larger memory savings, at the cost of having to do more endpoint recomputation.
For cuckoo30, we can mine in either 7 GB, 5 GB, or as little as 4 GB:

    $ ./cuda29 -E 0 | head -3
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",0) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 176 trims, and 64 thread blocks.
    Using 6976MB of global memory.
    $ ./cuda29 -E 1 | head -3
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",0) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 176 trims, and 64 thread blocks.
    Using 4848MB of global memory.
    Using 4848MB of global memory.
    $ ./cuda29 -E 2 | head -3
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",0) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 176 trims, and 64 thread blocks.
    Using 3488MB of global memory.

-m trims
------------
The number of trimming rounds. Default 176. Can be increased arbitrarily. At some point, there will be
no edges left to trim, as all remaining edges are already part of a cycle:

    $ ./cuda29 -m 1514
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",0) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 1514 trims, and 64 thread blocks.
    Using 6976MB of global memory.

      26-cycle found
    findcycles edges 88 time 2 ms total 2217 ms
    0 total solutions

Note that 88 is exactly the sum length of all 5 cycles.
Insufficient trimming results in loss of  edges and possible loss of cycles:

    $ ./cuda29 -n 63 -m 128
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",63) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 128 trims, and 64 thread blocks.

    $ ./cuda29 -n 63 -m 120
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",63) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 120 trims, and 64 thread blocks.
    Using 6976MB of global memory.
    nonce 63 k0 k1 k2 k3 7d4f06d5f68dc772 331017080ac63322 e62926ee68af70ed cf2efe7e2f4dbc16

    $ ./cuda29 -m 120
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",0) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 120 trims, and 64 thread blocks.
    Using 6976MB of global memory.
    nonce 0 k0 k1 k2 k3 a34c6a2bdaa03a14 d736650ae53eee9e 9a22f05e3bffed5e b8d55478fa3a606d

       2-cycle found
      16-cycle found
    findcycles edges 131072 time 17 ms total 1970 ms
    0 total solutions

In this case the 13796 lost edges included one of the 42 cycle edges.
    
-n nonce
------------
The starting nonce. Default 0. This 32-bit number is stored in the final 4 bytes of the header,
just before hashing it with Blake2b to derive the siphash keys which determine the 2^30 node graph.

-r range
------------
The number of consecutive nonces to solve. Default 1. An actual miner would just keep incrementing
the nonce forever, until a solution that meets the difficulty threshold is found by any miner,
at which point a new header needs to be build.

-U seedAblocks -u seedAthreads
------------
The number of threadblocks and threads per block to use in seeding round A.
Since round 0, generating U nodes, is only writing buckets, it can use
arbitrarily many threadblocks. Here's a table of seedA times with various
combinations of blocks and threads per block (tpb):

tpb\blocks |  256 | 1024 | 4096 | 16384
---------- |  --- |  --- |  --- |  ----
       64  |   67 |   62 |   58 |    58
      128  |   45 |   45 |   54 |    41
      256  |   43 |   43 |   40 |    39
      512  |   56 |   46 |   45 |    45
     1024  |   58 |   59 |   57 |    60

There is a related compile time define -DFLUSHA=16 that should grow along with tpb to avoid excessive edge loss:

    $ ./cuda29 -n 63 -u 512
    GeForce GTX 1080 Ti with 10GB @ 352 bits x 5505MHz
    Looking for 42-cycle on cuckoo30("",63) with 50% edges, 64*64 buckets, 176 trims, and 64 thread blocks.
    Using 6976MB of global memory.
    nonce 63 k0 k1 k2 k3 7d4f06d5f68dc772 331017080ac63322 e62926ee68af70ed cf2efe7e2f4dbc16

    $ ./cuda29 -n 63 -u 1024

    Seeding completed in 690 + 290 ms
    findcycles edges 4496 time 2 ms total 1991 ms
    0 total solutions

-v seedBthreads
------------
The number of threads per block to use in seeding round B.
Here's the effect on seedB times:

tpb |  16 | 32 | 64 | 128 | 256 | 512 | 1024
--- |  -- | -- | -- | --- | --- | --- |  ---
 ms |  93 | 55 | 36 |  31 |  33 |  34 |   32

Again there is a related compile time define -DFLUSHB=8 that should grow along with tpb to avoid excessive edge loss.

-w Trimthreads
------------
The number of threads per block to use in trimming rounds.
Here's the effect on total times:

tpb |  32 |  64 | 128 | 256 | 512 | 1024
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ----
 ms | 614 | 389 | 284 | 239 | 228 |  233



The three remaining options below have only a negligible impact on runtimes.

-y threads
------------
The number of threads per block to use in bucket compaction.

-Z threads
------------
The number of thread blocks to use in edge index recovery.

-z threads
------------
The number of threads per block to use in edge recovery.

Happy tuning!
