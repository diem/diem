Installing
----------

We strongly recommend that people use the latest official release tarball on
https://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html, and build with:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Official scrypt tarball releases should build and run on any IEEE Std 1003.1
(POSIX) compliant system which
  1. Includes the Software Development Utilities option,
  2. Has OpenSSL available via -lcrypto and #include <openssl/foo>, and
  3. Provides /dev/urandom.


libscrypt-kdf
-------------

To install the development library, run:

    ./configure --enable-libscrypt-kdf
    make install


Platform-specific notes
-----------------------

- On OS X, the version of OpenSSL included with the operating
  system is outdated (0.9.8) and deprecated, and it is recommended
  that scrypt be built with an updated version of OpenSSL.  On OS X
  10.11 "El Capitan" and higher, OpenSSL was removed entirely.  After
  installing a newer version of OpenSSL, use
      CPPFLAGS="-I /path/to/openssl/headers"
      LDFLAGS="-L /path/to/openssl/lib"
  to build scrypt.

  In particular, if you installed OpenSSL using homebrew, you may
  pass the relevant directories directly to ./configure:
      ./configure CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib"

  Alternatively, you may with to add these lines to your $HOME/.profile file:
      export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include $CPPFLAGS"
      export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib $LDFLAGS"
  and then close & re-open your terminal window.


Building from git
-----------------

For experimental development from git, build with:

    autoreconf -i
    ./configure
    make

- You must have automake 1.11.2 or higher, and libtool.
- In order to support the `AX_CFLAGS_WARN_ALL` autoconf directive, you will
  need to install the autoconf archive.  On Debian systems, use the
  `autoconf-archive` package; on FreeBSD, use `devel/autoconf-archive`.
- Ignore this message if it appears:
  aclocal: warning: couldn't open directory 'm4': No such file or directory
