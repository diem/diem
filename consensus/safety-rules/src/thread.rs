//! This provides a execution separation between SafetyRules and Consensus without requiring the
//! use of processes. Rust does not support fork and so the mechanics to actually construct a
//! SafetyRules that would run together and be started by Consensus requires a separate binary and
//! making a call to start that via a command. This is a lightweight means of accomplishing a goal
//! in testing correctness of the communication layer between Consensus and SafetyRules.
