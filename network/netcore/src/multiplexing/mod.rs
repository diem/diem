//! The main component of this module is the [`StreamMultiplexer`] trait, which
//! provides an interface for multiplexing multiple [`AsyncRead`]/[`AsyncWrite`] substreams over a
//! single underlying [`AsyncRead`]/[`AsyncWrite`] stream. [`Yamux`], an implementation of this
//! trait over [`TcpStream`], is also provided.
