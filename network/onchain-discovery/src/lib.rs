//! Protocol for discovering validator + validator full node network addresses
//! and identity keys via a shared on-chain discovery resource.
//!
//! ## Protocol
//!
//! + Bootstrapping
//!
//!     - query own storage for latest known discovery set.
//!     => peer set = seed peers (from config) and any peers in our storage's
//!        discovery set (might be very stale).
//!     - we must assume that we can connect to at least one of these peers from
//!       the bootstrapping phase, otherwise we will not be able to make progress.
//!
//! + Steady state
//!
//!     - query own storage for latest known discovery set.
//!     - query peers for their latest known discovery set and epoch changes
//!       between our current state and the peer's current state (if any).
//!     - updates to the discovery set (e.g., a validator is advertising a
//!       different network address) are sent to the connectivity manager.
//!
//! + Serving Queries
//!
//!     - all validators and validator full nodes serve queries on their current
//!       discovery set via LibraNet.
//!     - note that validators will only allow connections from other validators
//!       for DDoS mitigation.
//!     - responses include the most recent discovery set event with state proofs
//!       (emitted on reconfiguration) and any epoch changes needed to get the
//!       requestor up to the most recent epoch.
//!
//! ## Implementation
//!
//! The onchain discovery module is implemented as an actor that:
//!
//! 1. queries our own storage for our onchain discovery set
//! 2. services discovery set queries from our peers
//! 3. queries our peers for their discovery set
//! 4. notifies the connectivity_manager with updated network info whenever we
//!    detect a newer discovery set
