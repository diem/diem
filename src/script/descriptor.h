// Descriptors are strings that describe a set of scriptPubKeys, together with
// all information necessary to solve them. By combining all information into
// one, they avoid the need to separately import keys and scripts.
//
// Descriptors may be ranged, which occurs when the public keys inside are
// specified in the form of HD chains (xpubs).
//
// Descriptors always represent public information - public keys and scripts -
// but in cases where private keys need to be conveyed along with a descriptor,
// they can be included inside by changing public keys to private keys (WIF
// format), and changing xpubs by xprvs.
//
// Reference documentation about the descriptor language can be found in
// doc/descriptors.md.
