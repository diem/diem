# This is a list of test-only members. These are workspace members that do not form part of the main
# Libra production codebase, and are only used to verify correctness and/or performance.
#
# *** IMPORTANT ***
#
# Published developer tools (e.g. Move compiler) ARE part of the production Libra codebase.
# They should be listed in the root Cargo.toml's default-members, not here!
#
# Before adding a new crate to this list, ensure that it is *actually* test-only. If not, add it
# (or a crate that depends on it) to the root Cargo.toml's default-members list!
#
# For more, see the "Conditional compilation for tests" section in documentation/coding_guidelines.md.
