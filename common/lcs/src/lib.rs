//! # Libra Canonical Serialization (LCS)
//!
//! LCS defines a deterministic means for translating a message or data structure into bytes
//! irrespective of platform, architecture, or programming language.
//!
//! ## Background
//!
//! In Libra, participants pass around messages or data structures that often times need to be
//! signed by a prover and verified by one or more verifiers. Serialization in this context refers
//! to the process of converting a message into a byte array. Many serialization approaches support
//! loose standards such that two implementations can produce two different byte streams that would
//! represent the same, identical message. While for many applications, non-deterministic
//! serialization causes no issues, it does so for applications using serialization for
//! cryptographic purposes. For example, given a signature and a message, a verifier may not unable
//! to produce the same serialized byte array constructed by the prover when the prover signed the
//! message resulting in a non-verifiable message. In other words, to ensure message verifiability
//! when using non-deterministic serialization, participants must either retain the original
//! serialized bytes or risk losing the ability to verify messages. This creates a burden requiring
//! participants to maintain both a copy of the serialized bytes and the deserialized message often
//! leading to confusion about safety and correctness. While there exist a handful of existing
//! deterministic serialization formats, there is no obvious choice. To address this, we propose
//! Libra Canonical Serialization that defines a deterministic means for translating a message into
//! bytes and back again.
//!
//! ## Specification
//!
//! LCS supports the following data types:
//!
//! * Booleans
//! * Signed 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit integers
//! * Unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit integers
//! * Option
//! * Unit (an empty value)
//! * Fixed and variable length sequences
//! * UTF-8 Encoded Strings
//! * Tuples
//! * Structures (aka "structs")
//! * Externally tagged enumerations (aka "enums")
//! * Maps
//!
//! ## General structure
//!
//! LCS is not a self-describing format and as such, in order to deserialize a message, one must
//! know the message type and layout ahead of time.
//!
//! Unless specified, all numbers are stored in little endian, two's complement format.
//!
//! ## Recursion and Depth of LCS Data
//!
//! Recursive data-structures (e.g. trees) are allowed. However, because of the possibility of stack
//! overflow during (de)serialization, the *container depth* of any valid LCS data cannot exceed the constant
//! `MAX_CONTAINER_DEPTH`. Formally, we define *container depth* as the number of structs and enums traversed
//! during (de)serialization.
//!
//! This definition aims to minimize the number of operations while ensuring that
//! (de)serialization of a known LCS format cannot cause arbitrarily large stack allocations.
//!
//! As an example, if `v1` and `v2` are values of depth `n1` and `n2`,
//! * a struct value `Foo { v1, v2 }` has depth `1 + max(n1, n2)`;
//! * an enum value `E::Foo { v1, v2 }` has depth `1 + max(n1, n2)`;
//! * a pair `(v1, v2)` has depth `max(n1, n2)`;
//! * the value `Some(v1)` has depth `n1`.
//!
//! All string and integer values have depths `0`.
//!
//! ### Booleans and Integers

//!
//! ### ULEB128-Encoded Integers
//!
//! The LCS format also uses the [ULEB128 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) internally
//! to represent unsigned 32-bit integers in two cases where small values are usually expected:
//! (1) lengths of variable-length sequences and (2) tags of enum values (see the corresponding
//! sections below).
//!
//! |Type                       |Original data          |Hex representation |Serialized format  |
//! |---                        |---                    |---                |---                |
//! |ULEB128-encoded u32-integer|2^0 = 1                |0x00000001         |[01]               |
//! |                           |2^7 = 128              |0x00000080         |[8001]             |
//! |                           |2^14 = 16384           |0x00004000         |[808001]           |
//! |                           |2^21 = 2097152         |0x00200000         |[80808001]         |
//! |                           |2^28 = 268435456       |0x10000000         |[8080808001]       |
//! |                           |9487                   |0x0000250f         |[8f4a]             |
//!
//! In general, a ULEB128 encoding consists of a little-endian sequence of base-128 (7-bit)
//! digits. Each digit is completed into a byte by setting the highest bit to 1, except for the
//! last (highest-significance) digit whose highest bit is set to 0.
//!
//! In LCS, the result of decoding ULEB128 bytes is required to fit into a 32-bit unsigned
//! integer and be in canonical form. For instance, the following values are rejected:
//! * `[808080808001]` (2^36) is too large.
//! * `[8080808010]` (2^33) is too large.
//! * `[8000]` is not a minimal encoding of 0.
//!
//! ### Optional Data
//!
//! Optional or nullable data either exists in its full representation or does not. LCS represents
//! this as a single byte representing the presence `0x01` or absence `0x00` of data. If the data
//! is present then the serialized form of that data follows. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use libra_canonical_serialization::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let some_data: Option<u8> = Some(8);
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&some_data)?, vec![1, 8]);
//!
//! let no_data: Option<u8> = None;
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&no_data)?, vec![0]);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Fixed and Variable Length Sequences
//!
//! Sequences can be made of up of any LCS supported types (even complex structures) but all
//! elements in the sequence must be of the same type. If the length of a sequence is fixed and
//! well known then LCS represents this as just the concatenation of the serialized form of each
//! individual element in the sequence. If the length of the sequence can be variable, then the
//! serialized sequence is length prefixed with a ULEB128-encoded unsigned integer indicating
//! the number of elements in the sequence. All variable length sequences must be
//! `MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` elements long or less.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use libra_canonical_serialization::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let fixed: [u16; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&fixed)?, vec![1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0]);
//!
//! let variable: Vec<u16> = vec![1, 2];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&variable)?, vec![2, 1, 0, 2, 0]);
//!
//! let large_variable_length: Vec<()> = vec![(); 9_487];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&large_variable_length)?, vec![0x8f, 0x4a]);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Strings
//!
//! Only valid UTF-8 Strings are supported. LCS serializes such strings as a variable length byte
//! sequence, i.e. length prefixed with a ULEB128-encoded unsigned integer followed by the byte
//! representation of the string.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use libra_canonical_serialization::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! // Note that this string has 10 characters but has a byte length of 24
//! let utf8_str = "çå∞≠¢õß∂ƒ∫";
//! let expecting = vec![
//!     24, 0xc3, 0xa7, 0xc3, 0xa5, 0xe2, 0x88, 0x9e, 0xe2, 0x89, 0xa0, 0xc2,
//!     0xa2, 0xc3, 0xb5, 0xc3, 0x9f, 0xe2, 0x88, 0x82, 0xc6, 0x92, 0xe2, 0x88, 0xab,
//! ];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&utf8_str)?, expecting);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Tuples
//!
//! Tuples are typed composition of objects: `(Type0, Type1)`
//!
//! Tuples are considered a fixed length sequence where each element in the sequence can be a
//! different type supported by LCS. Each element of a tuple is serialized in the order it is
//! defined within the tuple, i.e. [tuple.0, tuple.2].
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use libra_canonical_serialization::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let tuple = (-1i8, "libra");
//! let expecting = vec![0xFF, 5, b'l', b'i', b'b', b'r', b'a'];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&tuple)?, expecting);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ### Structures
//!
//! Structures are fixed length sequences consisting of fields with potentially different types.
//! Each field within a struct is serialized in the order specified by the canonical structure
//! definition. Structs can exist within other structs and as such, LCS recurses into each struct
//! and serializes them in order. There are no labels in the serialized format, the struct ordering
//! defines the organization within the serialization stream.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use libra_canonical_serialization::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # use serde::Serialize;
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! # #[derive(Serialize)]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     boolean: bool,
//!     bytes: Vec<u8>,
//!     label: String,
//! }
//!
//! # #[derive(Serialize)]
//! struct Wrapper {
//!     inner: MyStruct,
//!     name: String,
//! }
//!
//! let s = MyStruct {
//!     boolean: true,
//!     bytes: vec![0xC0, 0xDE],
//!     label: "a".to_owned(),
//! };
//! let s_bytes = to_bytes(&s)?;
//! let mut expecting = vec![1, 2, 0xC0, 0xDE, 1, b'a'];
//! assert_eq!(s_bytes, expecting);
//!
//! let w = Wrapper {
//!     inner: s,
//!     name: "b".to_owned(),
//! };
//! let w_bytes = to_bytes(&w)?;
//! assert!(w_bytes.starts_with(&s_bytes));
//!
//! expecting.append(&mut vec![1, b'b']);
//! assert_eq!(w_bytes, expecting);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Externally Tagged Enumerations
//!
//! An enumeration is typically represented as a type that can take one of potentially many
//! different variants. In LCS, each variant is mapped to a variant index, a ULEB128-encoded 32-bit unsigned
//! integer, followed by serialized data if the type has an associated value. An
//! associated type can be any LCS supported type. The variant index is determined based on the
//! ordering of the variants in the canonical enum definition, where the first variant has an index
//! of `0`, the second an index of `1`, etc.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use libra_canonical_serialization::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # use serde::Serialize;
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! # #[derive(Serialize)]
//! enum E {
//!     Variant0(u16),
//!     Variant1(u8),
//!     Variant2(String),
//! }
//!
//! let v0 = E::Variant0(8000);
//! let v1 = E::Variant1(255);
//! let v2 = E::Variant2("e".to_owned());
//!
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&v0)?, vec![0, 0x40, 0x1F]);
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&v1)?, vec![1, 0xFF]);
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&v2)?, vec![2, 1, b'e']);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! If you need to serialize a C-style enum, you should use a primitive integer type.
//!
//! ### Maps (Key / Value Stores)
//!
//! Maps are represented as a variable-length, sorted sequence of (Key, Value) tuples. Keys must be
//! unique and the tuples sorted by increasing lexicographical order on the LCS bytes of each key.
//! The representation is otherwise similar to that of a variable-length sequence. In particular,
//! it is preceded by the number of tuples, encoded in ULEB128.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use libra_canonical_serialization::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # use std::collections::HashMap;
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let mut map = HashMap::new();
//! map.insert(b'e', b'f');
//! map.insert(b'a', b'b');
//! map.insert(b'c', b'd');
//!
//! let expecting = vec![(b'a', b'b'), (b'c', b'd'), (b'e', b'f')];
//!
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&map)?, to_bytes(&expecting)?);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Backwards compatibility
//!
//! Complex types dependent upon the specification in which they are used. LCS does not provide
//! direct provisions for versioning or backwards / forwards compatibility. A change in an objects
//! structure could prevent historical clients from understanding new clients and vice-versa.
