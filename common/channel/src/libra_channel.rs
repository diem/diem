//! libra_channel provides an mpsc channel which has two ends `libra_channel::Receiver`
//! and `libra_channel::Sender` similar to existing mpsc data structures.
//! What makes it different from existing mpsc channels is that we have full control
//! over how the internal queueing in the channel happens and how we schedule messages
//! to be sent out from this channel.
//! Note that libra_channel does not provide an implementation of this internal queueing
//! mechanism, but provides a trait (`MessageQueue`) which the consumers of this channel
//! can use to create libra_channels' according to their needs.
