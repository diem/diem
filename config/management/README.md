# Libra Management tools

The `libra-management` crate provides a framework for building CLI tools for various
purposes.  The purpose of breaking these into multiple tools is to simplify the user
experience, and prevent confusion between the different use cases.

### The Tools
```
libra-management
|-> libra-genesis-tool = A tool for performing the genesis ceremony for the Libra blockchain.
|-> libra-operational-tool = A tool for performing management operations on the Libra blockchain.
```

There are README's for each tool individually.
