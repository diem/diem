// The statuses and errors produced by the VM can be categorized into a
// couple different types:
// 1. Validation Statuses: all the errors that can (/should) be
//    the result of executing the prologue -- these are primarily used by
//    the vm validator and AC.
// 2. Verification Errors: errors that are the result of performing
//    bytecode verification (happens at the time of publishing).
// 3. VM Invariant Errors: errors that arise from an internal invariant of
//    the VM being violated. These signify a problem with either the VM or
//    bytecode verifier.
// 4. Binary Errors: errors that can occur during the process of
//    deserialization of a transaction.
// 5. Runtime Statuses: errors that can arise from the execution of a
//    transaction (assuming the prologue executes without error). These are
//    errors that can occur during execution due to things such as division
//    by zero, running out of gas, etc. These do not signify an issue with
//    the VM.
