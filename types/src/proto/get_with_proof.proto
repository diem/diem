// This file contains proto definitions for performing queries and getting back
// results with proofs.  This is the interface for a client to query data from
// the system. Every query result must include proof so that a client can be
// certain that the data returned is valid.  A client must verify this proof to
// ensure that a node isn't lying to them.

// How to verify the response as a client:
// (Note that every response comes in the form of GetWithProofResponse which
// wraps the inner response elements that correspond to the specific request
// types.  Below we will assume a single request/response type.  The
// verification can be extended as needed for multiple types. Also note that we
// will use the following notation: resp = GetWithProofResponse and req =
// GetWithProofRequest). Also note that the following will be considered
// equivalent for brevity: req.requested_items.get_account_state_request ==
// req.get_account_state_request And, resp.values.get_account_state_response ==
// resp.get_account_state_response
//
// GetAccountStateResponse:
// - let state_req = req.requested_items.get_account_state_request;
// - let state_resp = resp.values.get_account_state_response;
// - Verify that:
//      - state_req.access_path == state_resp.access_path
//          - This ensures that the server is responding with the correct access
//          path
// - let state_data_hash = Hash(state_resp.value);
// - let state_proof = resp.values.proof.state_proof_value.sparse_merkle_proof;
// - Validate state_proof using state_data_hash as the leaf
//      - When verifying the state tree, use:
//          state_root_hash = resp.values.transaction_info.state_root_hash
// - Validate accumulator using resp.values.transaction_info as the leaf
//      - When verifying the accumulator, use:
//          root_hash =
//          resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.ledger_info.txn_root_hash;
// - Validate that the transaction root hash submitted in
// req.known_value.node_value.txn_root_hash
//      exists in the proof for accumulator and that the proof is valid with
//      this hash
// - Validate ledger info
//      - let ledger_info_hash =
//      Hash(resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.ledger_info);
//      - Verify signatures from resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.signatures are
//      signing
//          ledger_info_hash and that there are >2/3 nodes signing this
//          correctly
//      - Validate that the timestamp is relatively recent in
//          resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.timestamp
//
//
// GetAccountTransactionBySequenceNumberResponse:
// - Note that other than type completed_transaction, there will be no proof
// returned
//      since the transaction has not yet been committed.  To ensure that a
//      validator is telling the truth about it not being committed yet, a
//      client should query for their account state and verify that their
//      current sequence number is less than what they are searching for with
//      GetAccountTransactionBySequenceNumberResponse
// - let txn =
//      resp.get_account_transaction_by_sequence_number_response.transaction.committed_transaction;
// - let txn_hash = Hash(txn);
// - Verify that resp.proof.transaction_info.signed_transaction_hash == txn_hash
// - Validate accumulator using resp.proof.transaction_info as the leaf
//      - When verifying the accumulator, use:
//          root_hash =
//          resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.ledger_info.txn_root_hash;
// - Validate that the transaction root hash submitted in
// req.known_value.node_value.txn_root_hash
//      exists in the proof for accumulator and that the proof is valid with
//      this hash
// - Validate ledger info
//      - let ledger_info_hash =
//      Hash(resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.ledger_info);
//      - Verify signatures from resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.signatures are
//      signing
//          ledger_info_hash and that there are >2/3 nodes signing this
//          correctly
//      - Validate that the timestamp is relatively recent in
//          resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.timestamp
//
//
// GetTransactionsResponse:
// - for txn in resp.get_transactions_response.transactions:
//      - let txn = txn.committed_transaction;
//      - let txn_hash = Hash(txn);
//      - Verify that txn.proof.transaction_info.signed_transaction_hash ==
//      txn_hash
//      - Validate accumulator using txn.proof.transaction_info as the leaf
//      - When verifying the accumulator, use:
//          root_hash =
//          resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.ledger_info.txn_root_hash;
//      - Verify that transactions are sequential and none are missing
// - Validate ledger info
//      - let ledger_info_hash =
//      Hash(resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.ledger_info);
//      - Verify signatures from resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.signatures are
//      signing
//          ledger_info_hash and that there are >2/3 nodes signing this
//          correctly
//      - Validate that the timestamp is relatively recent in
//          resp.ledger_info_with_sigs.ledger_info.timestamp
// - If the number of transactions returned is less than limit for an ascending
// query
//      or if the requested offset > current version for a descending query,
//      the client should verify that the timestamp in ledger info is relatively
//      recent to determine if it is likely that all transactions available were
//      returned
