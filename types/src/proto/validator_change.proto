// triggers an event on /validator_change_account/events/sent.  To tell the
// client about validator changes, we query
// /validator_change_account/events/sent to get all versions that contain
// validator changes after the version that we are trying to update from. For
// each of these versions, the old validator set would have signed the ledger
// info at that version.  The client needs this as well as the event results +
// proof.  The client can then verify that these events were under the current
// tree and that the changes were signed by the old validators (and that the
// events correctly show which validators are the new validators).
