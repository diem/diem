//! This module defines a data structure made to contain a cryptographic
//! signature, in the sense of an implementation of
//! libra_crypto::traits::Signature. The container is an opaque NewType that
//! intentionally does not allow access to the inner impl.
//!
//! It also proxies the four methods used in consensus on structures that
//! expect to receive one such implementation directly.
//!
//! The goal of this structure is two-fold:
//! - help make sure that any consensus data that uses cryptographic material is defined generically
//!   in terms of libra_crypto::traits, rather than accessing the implementation details of a particular
//!   scheme (a.k.a. encapsulation),
//! - contribute to a single-location place for instantiations of these polymorphic types
//!   (`crate::chained_bft::consensus_types`)
//! - help the consensus crate avoid generic parameters within the code, by avoiding propagating
//!   generic signature type parameters throughout the crate's code (as prototyped in https://github.com/libra/libra/pull/522),
//!   as generic types are seen as hindering readability.

// This sets the types containing cryptographic materials used in the
// consensus crate. It is intended as a one-stop shop for changing the
// signing scheme of the consensus. If consensus uses a type that
// contains cryptographic material, its polymorphic parameter should be
// instantiated here and re-exported.
//
// Imports specific to any signing scheme (e.g. ed25519::*) should not be
// present anywhere in the consensus crate. Use of raw cryptographic
// types that do not go through the instantiated polymorphic structures
// below is banned.
