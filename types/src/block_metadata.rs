/// Struct that will be persisted on chain to store the information of the current block.

/// 1. The executor will pass this struct to VM at the end of a block proposal.
/// 2. The VM will use this struct to create a special system transaction that will modify the on
///    chain resource that represents the information of the current block. This transaction can't
///    be emitted by regular users and is generated by each of the validators on the fly. Such
///    transaction will be executed before all of the user-submitted transactions in the blocks.
/// 3. Once that special resource is modified, the other user transactions can read the consensus
///    info by calling into the read method of that resource, which would thus give users the
///    information such as the current leader.
