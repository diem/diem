/// A module which implements secure memory (called a *vault*) of some content which can only be operated
/// on if authorized by a signer. Authorization is managed by
/// [*capabilities*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security). The vault supports delegation
/// of capabilities to other signers (including revocation) as well as transfer of ownership.
///
/// # Overview
///
/// ## Capabilities
///
/// Capabilities are unforgeable tokens which represent the right to perform a particular
/// operation on the vault. To acquire a capability instance, authentication via a signer is needed.
/// This signer must either be the owner of the vault, or someone the capability has been delegated to.
////
/// Once acquired, a capability can be passed to other functions to perform the operation it enables.
/// Specifically, those called functions do not need to have access to the original signer. This is a key
/// property of capability based security as it prevents granting more rights to code than needed.
///
/// Capability instances are unforgeable because they are localized to transactions. They can only be
/// created by functions of this module, and as they do not have the Move language `store` or `key` abilities,
/// they cannot leak out of a transaction.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```move
/// struct Content has store { ssn: u64 }
/// ...
/// // Create new vault
/// Vault::new(signer, b"My Vault", Content{ ssn: 525659745 });
/// ...
/// // Obtain a read capability
/// let read_cap = Vault::acquire_read_cap<Content>(signer);
/// process(&read_cap)
/// ...
/// fun process(cap: &Vault::ReadCap<Content>) {
///     let accessor = Vault::read_accessor(cap);
///     let content = Vault::borrow(accessor);
///     << do something with `content: &Content` >>
///     Vault::release_read_accessor(accessor);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Delegation
///
/// Delegation provides the option to delegate the right to acquire a vault capability to other
/// signers than the owner of the vault. Delegates still need to authenticate themselves using their
/// signer, similar as the owner does. All security arguments for owners apply also to delegates.
/// Delegation can be revoked removing previously granted rights from a delegate.
///
/// Delegation can be configured to be transitive by granting the right to acquire a delegation capability
/// to delegates, which can then further delegate access rights.
///
/// By default, when a vault is created, it does not support delegation. The owner of the vault
/// needs to explicitly enable delegation. This allows to create vaults which are not intended for delegation
/// and one does not need to worry about its misuse.
///
/// Example:
///
/// ```move
/// Vault::new(signer, b"My Vault", Content{ ssn: 525659745 });
/// // Enable delegation for this vault. Only the owning signer can do this.
/// Vault::enable_delegation<Content>(signer);
/// ...
/// // Delegate read capability to some other signer.
/// let delegate_cap = Vault::acquire_delegate_cap<Content>(signer);
/// Vault::delegate_read_cap(&delegate_cap, other_signer);
/// ...
/// // Other signer can now acquire read cap
/// let read_cap = Vault::acquire_read_cap<Content>(other_signer);
/// ...
/// // The granted capability can be revoked. There is no need to have the other signer for this.
/// Vault::revoke_read_cap(&delegate_cap, Signer::address_of(other_signer));
/// ```
///
/// ## Abilities
///
/// Currently, we require that the `Content` type of a vault has the `drop` ability in order to instantiate
/// a capability type like `ReadCap<Content>`. Without this, capabilities themselves would need to have an
/// explicit release function, which makes little sense as they are pure values. We expect the Move
/// language to have 'phantom type parameters' or similar features added, which will allows us to have
/// `ReadCap<Content>` droppable and copyable without `Content` needing the same.
