// The gas schedule keeps two separate schedules for the gas:
// * The instruction_schedule: This holds the gas for each bytecode instruction.
// * The native_schedule: This holds the gas for used (per-byte operated over) for each native
//   function.
// A couple notes:
// 1. In the case that an instruction is deleted from the bytecode, that part of the cost schedule
//    still needs to remain the same; once a slot in the table is taken by an instruction, that is its
//    slot for the rest of time (since that instruction could already exist in a module on-chain).
// 2. The initialization of the module will publish the instruction table to the association
//    address, and will preload the vector with the gas schedule for instructions. The VM will then
//    load this into memory at the startup of each block.
