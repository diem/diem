There are three experimental scripts in this folder.
- `install-dotnet.sh` installs Dotnet Core.
- `install-boogie.sh` installs a specific version of Boogie from nuget.org.
- `install-z3.sh` installs a specific version of Z3.

# Installation steps

1. The installation of Dotnet Core requires a few directories to be writable by your
   user account.  You should change the ownership of these directories to your user.
   - sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/sbin
   Then make sure that your user has write permission.
   - chmod u+w /usr/local/bin /usr/local/lib /usr/local/sbin
2. ./install-dotnet.sh
3. ./install-boogie.sh
4. ./install-z3.sh

Troubleshooting:
On bash, the commands `boogie` and `z3` should be in your path once these scripts
have finished successfully.  On zsh, you may have to add /Users/$(whoami)/.dotnet/tools
manually to $PATH.

# Setting environment variables for running Move Prover

The Move Prover looks for Boogie and Z3 executables in the environment variables BOOGIE_EXE
and Z3_EXE, respectively.  To run Boogie/Z3 on the Boogie files generated by the tests of
this crate, these environment variables must be set. To check the location of the tools,
use the following commands:
```
which boogie
which z3
# alternatively
type -p boogie
type -p z3
```
The following commands should set BOOGIE_EXE and Z3_EXE appropriately.
```
export BOOGIE_EXE=/Users/$(whoami)/.dotnet/tools/boogie
export Z3_EXE=/usr/local/bin/z3
```
