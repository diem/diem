There are three experimental scripts in this folder.
1. `install-dotnet.sh` installs Dotnet Core.
2. `install-boogie.sh` installs the latest version of Boogie from nuget.org.
3. `install-z3.sh` installs a specific version of Z3.

`install-dotnet.sh` must be executed before `install-boogie.sh`.  There is no other dependency.

The commands `boogie` and `z3` should be in your path once these scripts have finished successfully.

To check the location of the tools installed, use the following commands:
```
which boogie
which z3
# alternatively
type -p boogie
type -p z3
```

The Move Prover looks for Boogie and Z3 executables in the environment variables BOOGIE_EXE
and Z3_EXE, respectively.  To run Boogie/Z3 on the Boogie files generated by the tests of
this crate, these environment variables must be set.  To set these environment variables,
execute the following at the command-line after running the installation scripts described
above:
```
export BOOGIE_EXE=~/.dotnet/tools/boogie
export Z3_EXE=/usr/local/bin/z3
```
