This lab is used to compare the monomorphizing backend with the polymorphic one.
See general info for working with Jupyter in the [lab/README.md](../../README.md).

To view the results of the current benchmark data, use:

```
./notebook.sh
```

To regenerate the benchmark data, use:

```
./run.sh
```

You can keep the notebook open in the browser when you regenerate for experimentation.
Simply re-evaluate all cells from the point where the data is read. This will be much faster as
starting the notebook again after regeneration.
