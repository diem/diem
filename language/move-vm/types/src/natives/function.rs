//! Native Function Support
//!
//! All move native functions have the following signature:
//!
//! `pub fn native_function(
//!     context: &mut impl NativeContext,
//!     ty_args: Vec<Type>,
//!     mut arguments: VecDeque<Value>,
//! ) -> VMResult<NativeResult>;`
//!
//! arguments are passed with first argument at position 0 and so forth.
//! Popping values from `arguments` gives the aguments in reverse order (last first).
//! This module contains the declarations and utilities to implement a native
//! function.
