    ///     transaction, it will be loaded into the code cache and stay there even if the resulted
    ///     effects do not get commited back to the storage when the Session ends.
    ///   - As a result, if one wants to have multiple sessions at a time, one needs to make sure
    ///     none of them will try to publish a module. In other words, if there is a module publishing
    ///     Session it must be the only Session existing.
    ///   - In general, a new Move VM needs to be created whenever the storage gets modified by an
    ///     outer envrionment, or otherwise the states may be out of sync. There are a few exceptional
    ///     cases where this may not be necessary, with the most notable one being the common module
    ///     publishing flow: you can keep using the same Move VM if you publish some modules in a Session
    ///     and apply the effects to the storage when the Session ends.
