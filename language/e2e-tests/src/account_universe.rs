//! A model to test properties of common Libra transactions.
//!
//! The structs and functions in this module together form a simplified *model* of how common Libra
//! transactions should behave. This model is then used as an *oracle* for property-based tests --
//! the results of executing transactions through the VM should match the results computed using
//! this model.
//!
//! For examples of property-based tests written against this model, see the
