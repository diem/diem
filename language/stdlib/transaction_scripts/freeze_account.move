/// # Summary
/// Freezes the account at `address`. The sending account of this transaction
/// must be the Treasury Compliance account. The account being frozen cannot be
/// the Libra Root or Treasury Compliance account. After the successful
/// execution of this transaction no transactions may be sent from the frozen
/// account, and the frozen account may not send or receive coins.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// Sets the `AccountFreezing::FreezingBit` to `true` and emits a
/// `AccountFreezing::FreezeAccountEvent`. The transaction sender must be the
/// Treasury Compliance account, but the account at `to_freeze_account` must
/// not be either `0xA550C18` (the Libra Root address), or `0xB1E55ED` (the
/// Treasury Compliance address). Note that this is a per-account property
/// e.g., freezing a Parent VASP will not effect the status any of its child
/// accounts and vice versa.
///
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution of this transaction will emit a `AccountFreezing::FreezeAccountEvent` on
/// the `freeze_event_handle` held in the `AccountFreezing::FreezeEventsHolder` resource published
/// under `0xA550C18` with the `frozen_address` being the `to_freeze_account`.
