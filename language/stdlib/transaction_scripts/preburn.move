/// # Summary
/// Moves a specified number of coins in a given currency from the account's
/// balance to its preburn area after which the coins may be burned. This
/// transaction may be sent by any account that holds a balance and preburn area
/// in the specified currency.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// Moves the specified `amount` of coins in `Token` currency from the sending `account`'s
/// `LibraAccount::Balance<Token>` to the `Libra::Preburn<Token>` published under the same
/// `account`. `account` must have both of these resources published under it at the start of this
/// transaction in order for it to execute successfully.
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution of this script emits two events:
/// * `LibraAccount::SentPaymentEvent ` on `account`'s `LibraAccount::LibraAccount` `sent_events`
/// handle with the `payee` and `payer` fields being `account`'s address; and
/// * A `Libra::PreburnEvent` with `Token`'s currency code on the
/// `Libra::CurrencyInfo<Token`'s `preburn_events` handle for `Token` and with
/// `preburn_address` set to `account`'s address.
