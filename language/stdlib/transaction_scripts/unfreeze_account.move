/// # Summary
/// Unfreezes the account at `address`. The sending account of this transaction must be the
/// Treasury Compliance account. After the successful execution of this transaction transactions
/// may be sent from the previously frozen account, and coins may be sent and received.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// Sets the `AccountFreezing::FreezingBit` to `false` and emits a
/// `AccountFreezing::UnFreezeAccountEvent`. The transaction sender must be the Treasury Compliance
/// account. Note that this is a per-account property so unfreezing a Parent VASP will not effect
/// the status any of its child accounts and vice versa.
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution of this script will emit a `AccountFreezing::UnFreezeAccountEvent` with
/// the `unfrozen_address` set the `to_unfreeze_account`'s address.
///
