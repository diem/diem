/// # Summary
/// Mints LBR from the sending account's constituent coins by depositing in the
/// on-chain LBR reserve. Deposits the newly-minted LBR into the sending
/// account. Can be sent by any account that can hold balances for the constituent
/// currencies for LBR and LBR.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// Mints `amount_lbr` LBR from the sending account's constituent coins and deposits the
/// resulting LBR into the sending account.
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution of this script emits three events:
/// * A `LibraAccount::SentPaymentEvent` with the Coin1 currency code, and a
/// `LibraAccount::SentPaymentEvent` with the Coin2 currency code on `account`'s
/// `LibraAccount::LibraAccount` `sent_events` handle with the `amounts` for each event being the
/// components amounts of `amount_lbr` LBR; and
/// * A `LibraAccount::ReceivedPaymentEvent` on `account`'s `LibraAccount::LibraAccount`
/// `received_events` handle with the LBR currency code and amount field equal to `amount_lbr`.
///

// # Specified List of Abort Conditions
// > TODO(emmazzz): the documentation below documents the reasons of abort, instead of the categories.
// > We might want to discuss about what the best approach is here.
// The following abort conditions have been formally specified and verified. See spec schema
// `LibraAccount::StapleLBRAbortsIf` for the formal specifications.
//
// ## Aborts Caused by Invalid Account State
// * Aborts with `LibraAccount::EINSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` if `amount_coin1` is greater than sending
// `account`'s balance in `Coin1` or if `amount_coin2` is greater than sending `account`'s balance in `Coin2`.
// * Aborts with `LibraAccount::ECOIN_DEPOSIT_IS_ZERO` if `amount_lbr` is zero.
// * Aborts with `LibraAccount::EPAYEE_DOES_NOT_EXIST` if no LibraAccount exists at the address of `account`.
// * Aborts with `LibraAccount::EPAYEE_CANT_ACCEPT_CURRENCY_TYPE` if LibraAccount exists at `account`,
// but it does not accept payments in LBR.
//
// ## Aborts Caused by Invalid LBR Minting State
// * Aborts with `Libra::EMINTING_NOT_ALLOWED` if minting LBR is not allowed according to the CurrencyInfo<LBR>
// stored at `CURRENCY_INFO_ADDRESS`.
// * Aborts with `Libra::ECURRENCY_INFO` if the total value of LBR would reach `MAX_U128` after `amount_lbr`
// LBR is minted.
//
// ## Other Aborts
// These aborts should only happen when `account` has account limit restrictions or
// has been frozen by Libra administrators.
// * Aborts with `LibraAccount::EWITHDRAWAL_EXCEEDS_LIMITS` if `account` has exceeded their daily
// withdrawal limits for Coin1 or Coin2.
// * Aborts with `LibraAccount::EDEPOSIT_EXCEEDS_LIMITS` if `account` has exceeded their daily
// deposit limits for LBR.
// * Aborts with `LibraAccount::EACCOUNT_FROZEN` if `account` is frozen.
//
// # Post Conditions
// The following post conditions have been formally specified and verified. See spec schema
// `LibraAccount::StapleLBREnsures` for the formal specifications.
//
// ## Changed States
// * The reserve backing for Coin1 and Coin2 increase by the right amounts as specified by the component ratio.
// * Coin1 and Coin2 balances at the address of sending `account` decrease by the right amounts as specified by
// the component ratio.
// * The total value of LBR increases by `amount_lbr`.
// * LBR balance at the address of sending `account` increases by `amount_lbr`.
//
// ## Unchanged States
// * The total values of Coin1 and Coin2 stay the same.
