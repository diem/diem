/// # Summary
/// Script to allow or disallow minting of new coins in a specified currency.  This transaction can
/// only be sent by the Treasury Compliance account.  Turning minting off for a currency will have
/// no effect on coins already in circulation, and coins may still be removed from the system.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// This transaction sets the `can_mint` field of the `Libra::CurrencyInfo<Currency>` resource
/// published under `0xA550C18` to the value of `allow_minting`. Minting of coins if allowed if
/// this field is set to `true` and minting of new coins in `Currency` is disallowed otherwise.
/// This transaction needs to be sent by the Treasury Compliance account.
