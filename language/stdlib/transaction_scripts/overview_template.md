# Overview of Libra Transaction Scripts


> {{move-toc}}

## Background
Executing a transaction script can result in a number of different error
conditions and statuses being returned for a transaction that is committed
on-chain. These can be categorized into two buckets:
* [Predefined statuses](#predefined-statuses): are specific statuses that are returned from the VM, e.g., `OutOfGas`, or `Executed`; and
* [Move Abort errors](#move-aborts): are errors that are raised from the Move modules and/or scripts published on-chain.

There are also a number of statuses that can be returned at the time of
submission of the transaction to the system through JSON-RPC, these are detailed in the
[JSON-RPC specification](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/json-rpc/docs/method_submit.md#errors).

### Predefined Statuses

The predefined set of runtime statuses that can be returned to the user as a
result of executing any transaction script is given by the following table:

| Name                     | Description                                                                                              |
| ----                     | ---                                                                                                      |
| `Executed`               | The transaction was executed successfully.                                                               |
| `OutOfGas`               | The transaction ran out of gas during execution.                                                         |
| `MiscellaneousError`     | The transaction was malformed, e.g., an argument was not in LCS format. Possible, but unlikely to occur. |
| `ExecutionFailure{ ...}` | The transaction encountered an uncaught error. Possible, but unlikely to occur.                          |

**This set of statuses is considered stable**, and they should not be expected to
change. Any changes will be publicized and an upgrade process will be outlined
if/when these statuses or their meanings are updated.

### Move Aborts

Each Move abort error status consists of two pieces of data:
* The Move `location` where the abort was raised. This can be either from within a `Script` or from within a specific `Module`.
* The `abort_code` that was raised.

The `abort_code` is a `u64` that is constructed from two values:
1. The **error category** which is encoded in the lower 8 bits of the code. Error categories are
   declared in the `Errors` module and are globally unique across the Libra framework. There is a limited
   fixed set of predefined categories, and the framework is guaranteed to use these consistently.
2. The **error reason** which is encoded in the remaining 54 bits of the code. The reason is a unique
   number relative to the module which raised the error and can be used to obtain more information about
   the error at hand. It should primarily be used for diagnosis purposes. Error reasons may change over time as the
   framework evolves.

The most common set of Move abort errors that can be returned depend on the transaction script
and they are therefore detailed in the documentation for each transaction
script. Each abort condition is broken down into its category, reason, and a
description of the error in the context of the particular transaction script
e.g.,

| Error Category           | Error Reason                                | Description                                               |
| ----------------         | --------------                              | -------------                                             |
| `Errors::NOT_PUBLISHED`  | `LibraAccount::EPAYER_DOESNT_HOLD_CURRENCY` | `payer` doesn't hold a balance in `Currency`.             |
| `Errors::LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | `LibraAccount::EINSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`       | `amount` is greater than `payer`'s balance in `Currency`. |

For each of these tables, the **error categories should be considered stable**;
any changes to these categories will be be well-publicized in advance. On the
other hand, the **error reasons should be considered only semi-stable**; changes
to these may occur without notice, but changes are not expected to be common.

#### Move Explain

The abort conditions detailed in each transaction script are not meant to
be complete, but the list of error categories are. Additionally, any abort conditions
raised will have a human readable explanation attached to it (if possible) in the
[response](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/json-rpc/docs/type_transaction.md#type-moveabortexplanation)
from a
[JSON-RPC query for a committed transaction](https://github.com/libra/libra/blob/master/json-rpc/json-rpc-spec.md).
These explanations are based off of the human-understandable explanations provided by the
[Move Explain](https://github.com/libra/libra/tree/master/language/tools/move-explain)
tool which can also be called on the command-line.

## Transaction Script Summaries
---

The set of transaction scripts that are allowed to be sent to the blockchain
can be categorized into six different buckets:
* [Account Creation](#account-creation)
* [Account Administration](#account-administration)
* [Payments](#payments)
* [Validator and Validator Operator Administration](#validator-and-validator-operator-administration)
* [Treasury and Compliance Operations](#treasury-and-compliance-operations)
* [System Administration](#system-administration)

This section contains a brief summary for each along with a link to the script's
detailed documentation. The entire list of detailed documentation for each
transaction script categorized in the same manner as here can be found in the
[transaction scripts](#transaction-scripts) section in this document.
