/// # Summary
/// Updates the url used for off-chain communication, and the public key used to verify dual
/// attestation on-chain. Transaction can be sent by any account that has dual attestation
/// information published under it. In practice the only such accounts are Designated Dealers and
/// Parent VASPs.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// Updates the `base_url` and `compliance_public_key` fields of the `DualAttestation::Credential`
/// resource published under `account`. The `new_key` must be a valid ed25519 public key.
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution of this transaction emits two events:
/// * A `DualAttestation::ComplianceKeyRotationEvent` containing the new compliance public key, and
/// the blockchain time at which the key was updated emitted on the `DualAttestation::Credential`
/// `compliance_key_rotation_events` handle published under `account`; and
/// * A `DualAttestation::BaseUrlRotationEvent` containing the new base url to be used for
/// off-chain communication, and the blockchain time at which the url was updated emitted on the
/// `DualAttestation::Credential` `base_url_rotation_events` handle published under `account`.
