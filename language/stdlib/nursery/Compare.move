    /// This function is designed to compare BCS (Binary Canonical Serialization)-encoded values
    /// (i.e., vectors produced by `BCS::to_bytes`). A typical client will call
    /// `Compare::cmp_bcs_bytes(BCS::to_bytes(&t1), BCS::to_bytes(&t2))`. The comparison provides the
    /// following guarantees w.r.t the original values t1 and t2:
    /// - `cmp_bcs_bytes(bcs(t1), bcs(t2)) == LESS_THAN` iff `cmp_bcs_bytes(t2, t1) == GREATER_THAN`
    /// - `Compare::cmp<T>(t1, t2) == EQUAL` iff `t1 == t2` and (similarly)
    ///   `Compare::cmp<T>(t1, t2) != EQUAL` iff `t1 != t2`, where `==` and `!=` denote the Move
    ///    bytecode operations for polymorphic equality.
    /// - for all primitive types `T` with `<` and `>` comparison operators exposed in Move bytecode
    ///   (`u8`, `u64`, `u128`), we have
    ///   `compare_bcs_bytes(bcs(t1), bcs(t2)) == LESS_THAN` iff `t1 < t2` and (similarly)
    ///   `compare_bcs_bytes(bcs(t1), bcs(t2)) == LESS_THAN` iff `t1 > t2`.
    ///
    /// For all other types, the order is whatever the BCS encoding of the type and the comparison
    /// strategy above gives you. One case where the order might be surprising is the `address`
    /// type.
    /// CoreAddresses are 16 byte hex values that BCS encodes with the identity function. The right
    /// to left, byte-by-byte comparison means that (for example)
    /// `compare_bcs_bytes(bcs(0x01), bcs(0x10)) == LESS_THAN` (as you'd expect), but
    /// `compare_bcs_bytes(bcs(0x100), bcs(0x001)) == LESS_THAN` (as you probably wouldn't expect).
