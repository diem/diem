/// Provides a way to transfer structs from one account to another in two transactions.
/// Unlike many languages, Move cannot move data from one account to another with
/// single-signer transactions. As of this writing, ordinary transactions can only have
/// a single signer, and Move code can only store to an address (via `move_to`) if it
/// can supply a reference to a signer for the destination address (there are special case
/// exceptions in Genesis and LibraAccount where there can temporarily be multiple signers).
///
/// Offer solves this problem by providing an `Offer` resource.  To move a struct `T` from
/// account A to B, account A first publishes an `Offer<T>` resource at `address_of(A)`,
/// using the `Offer::create` function.
/// Then account B, in a separate transaction, can move the struct `T` from the `Offer` at
/// A's address to the desired destination. B accesses the resource using the `redeem` function,
/// which aborts unless the `for` field is B's address (preventing other addresses from
/// accessing the `T` that is intended only for B). A can also redeem the `T` value if B hasn't
/// redeemed it.
