    /*
    This module defines the synthetic coin type called LBR and the operations on LBR coins. A global property that this
    module has to satisfy is as follows: LBR must be backed by the reserve of fiat coins in order to exist. In the
    current system, there are two fiat coins called coin1 and coin2. So, there must be a sufficient amounts of coin1
    and coin2 respectively in the reserve to be backing LBR. Here, the "sufficient amount" is determined by the
    pre-defined ratio of each of the fiat coins to the total value of LBR. To define this global property more precisely,

    let reserve_coin1 refer to global<Reserve>(CoreAddresses::LIBRA_ROOT_ADDRESS()).coin1 (the reserve of coin1 backing LBR)
    let reserve_coin2 refer to global<Reserve>(CoreAddresses::LIBRA_ROOT_ADDRESS()).coin2 (the reserve of coin2 backing LBR).
    Let lbr_total_value be the synthetic variable that represents the total amount of LBR that exists.
    Note: lbr_total_value could refer to global<Libra::CurrencyInfo<LBR::T>>(CoreAddresses::LIBRA_ROOT_ADDRESS()).total_value, but this may make
    verification harder because one need prove a relational invariant of two modules (such as Libra and LBR).
    The module invariant can be formulated as:
    (1) lbr_total_value * r_coin1.ratio <= reserve_coin1.backing.value, and
    (2) lbr_total_value * r_coin2.ratio <= reserve_coin2.backing.value
    where '*' is the multiplication over real numbers. (Yet, it could be the FP multiplication. It should not matter.)

    Note that to argue this, the system needs to satisfy the following property (beyond the scope of this module):
    LBR coins should be created only through LBR::create, and there is no other way in the system. Specifically,
    Libra::mint<LBR::T> should not be able to create LBR coins because if so, the invariant above may not be guaranteed.
