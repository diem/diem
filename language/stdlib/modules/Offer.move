  This module defines a resource `Offer` that is used as a permissioned trading scheme between accounts.
  It defines two main functions for creating and retrieving a struct offered by some user
  inside the resource `Offer` under the offerer's account.

  Currently, the only other module that depends on this module is LibraConfig, where it's used to
  pass a capability to an account that allows it to modify a config.
