    //   function.
    // A couple notes:
    // 1. In the case that an instruction is deleted from the bytecode, that part of the cost schedule
    //    still needs to remain the same; once a slot in the table is taken by an instruction, that is its
    //    slot for the rest of time (since that instruction could already exist in a module on-chain).
    // 2. The initialization of the module will publish the instruction table to the association
    //    address, and will preload the vector with the gas schedule for instructions. The VM will then
    //    load this into memory at the startup of each block.
