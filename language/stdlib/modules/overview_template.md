# Libra Move Framework

This is the root document for the Libra framework module documentation. The Libra framework provides a set of Move
modules which define the resources and functions available for the Libra blockchain. Each module is individually
documented here, together with it's implementation and [formal specification](../../../move-prover/doc/user/spec-lang.md).

Move modules are not directly called by clients, but instead are used to implement *transaction scripts*.
For documentation of transaction scripts which constitute the client API, see
[../../transaction_scripts/doc/overview.md](../../transaction_scripts/doc/overview.md).
