/// Module defining error codes used in Move aborts throughout the framework.
///
/// A `u64` error code is constructed from two values:
///
///  1. The *error category* which is encoded in the lower 8 bits of the code. Error categories are
///     declared in this module and are globally unique across the Libra framework. There is a limited
///     fixed set of predefined categories, and the framework is guaranteed to use those consistently.
///
///  2. The *error reason* which is encoded in the remaining 54 bits of the code. The reason is a unique
///     number relative to the module which raised the error and can be used to obtain more information about
///     the error at hand. It is mostly used for diagnosis purposes. Error reasons may change over time as the
///     framework evolves. TODO(wrwg): determine what kind of stability guarantees we give about reasons/
///     associated module.
