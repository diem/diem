    // Transaction Fee Distribution
    ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // Implements a basic transaction fee distribution logic.
    //
    // We have made a couple design decisions here that are worth noting:
    //  * We pay out once per-block for now.
    //    TODO: Once we have a better on-chain representation of
    //          epochs this should be changed over to be once per-epoch.
    //  * Sometimes the number of validators does not evenly divide the transaction fees to be
    //    distributed. In such cases the remainder ("dust") is left in the transaction fees pot and
    //    these remaining fees will be included in the calculations for the transaction fee
    //    distribution in the next epoch. This distribution strategy is meant to in part minimize the
    //    benefit of being the first validator in the validator set.
