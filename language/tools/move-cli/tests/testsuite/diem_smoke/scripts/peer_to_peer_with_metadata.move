/// # Summary
/// Transfers a given number of coins in a specified currency from one account to another.
/// Transfers over a specified amount defined on-chain that are between two different VASPs, or
/// other accounts that have opted-in will be subject to on-chain checks to ensure the receiver has
/// agreed to receive the coins.  This transaction can be sent by any account that can hold a
/// balance, and to any account that can hold a balance. Both accounts must hold balances in the
/// currency being transacted.
///
/// # Technical Description
///
/// Transfers `amount` coins of type `Currency` from `payer` to `payee` with (optional) associated
/// `metadata` and an (optional) `metadata_signature` on the message
/// `metadata` | `Signer::address_of(payer)` | `amount` | `DualAttestation::DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`.
/// The `metadata` and `metadata_signature` parameters are only required if `amount` >=
/// `DualAttestation::get_cur_microdiem_limit` XDX and `payer` and `payee` are distinct VASPs.
/// However, a transaction sender can opt in to dual attestation even when it is not required
/// (e.g., a DesignatedDealer -> VASP payment) by providing a non-empty `metadata_signature`.
/// Standardized `metadata` BCS format can be found in `diem_types::transaction::metadata::Metadata`.
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution of this script emits two events:
/// * A `DiemAccount::SentPaymentEvent` on `payer`'s `DiemAccount::DiemAccount` `sent_events` handle; and
/// * A `DiemAccount::ReceivedPaymentEvent` on `payee`'s `DiemAccount::DiemAccount` `received_events` handle.
