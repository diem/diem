/// # Summary
/// Mints a specified number of coins in a currency to a Designated Dealer. The sending account
/// must be the Treasury Compliance account, and coins can only be minted to a Designated Dealer
/// account.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// Mints `mint_amount` of coins in the `CoinType` currency to Designated Dealer account at
/// `designated_dealer_address`. The `tier_index` parameter specifies which tier should be used to
/// check verify the off-chain approval policy, and is based in part on the on-chain tier values
/// for the specific Designated Dealer, and the number of `CoinType` coins that have been minted to
/// the dealer over the past 24 hours. Every Designated Dealer has 4 tiers for each currency that
/// they support. The sending `tc_account` must be the Treasury Compliance account, and the
/// receiver an authorized Designated Dealer account.
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution of the transaction will emit two events:
/// * A `Diem::MintEvent` with the amount and currency code minted is emitted on the
/// `mint_event_handle` in the stored `Diem::CurrencyInfo<CoinType>` resource stored under
/// `0xA550C18`; and
/// * A `DesignatedDealer::ReceivedMintEvent` with the amount, currency code, and Designated
/// Dealer's address is emitted on the `mint_event_handle` in the stored `DesignatedDealer::Dealer`
/// resource published under the `designated_dealer_address`.
