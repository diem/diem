/// 0 balances for all available currencies in the system will also be added. This can only be
/// invoked by an account with the TreasuryCompliance role.
///
/// At the time of creation the account is also initialized with default mint tiers of (500_000,
/// 5000_000, 50_000_000, 500_000_000), and preburn areas for each currency that is added to the
/// account.
