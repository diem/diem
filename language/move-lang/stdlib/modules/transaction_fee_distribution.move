// This module implements a basic transaction fee distribution logic.
//
// We have made a couple design decisions here that are worth noting:
//  * We pay out per-epoch. However this functionality is only in spirit at the moment
//    since we have neither block metadata transactions nor epochs (at the Move level).
//    TODO: Once we have block metadata transactions and epochs, this code needs to be updated to
//    distribute fees every epoch and be called from the metadata transaction.
//  * In the handling of dust, we simply leave it to the next distribution.
//    This is meant to in part minimize the benefit of being the first validator in
//    the validator set.
