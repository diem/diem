# P0

## Soundness

* SCC generic check
* main args?

## Cohesion

* Type inference nonsense (overtightened in types from parsing to typing)

# P1

* Function args with `_`

# P2

* Traits on AST/Context
* Context in separate files
* location stack tracking
  if (true) R{} else R{} points to unused resource really weirdly
* Better messages for unexpected exps in Expansion passes
* Stop using box::leak and atomicusize, pass around compiliation context
* Address aliases
* Using all sorts of aliases in error messages
  * i.e. 0x00000000000000384028920984.M.S becomes Sender.M.S

# P3

* Dead resource/struct decls
* Dead field decls
* Unused type params
* Plurals in errors
* .. patterns in lvalues for structs
* move out of owned struct fields
  * supporting x.f where x: S (i.e. move x.f)

# P4

* improve language character set
* improve comments
