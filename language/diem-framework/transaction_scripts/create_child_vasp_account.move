/// # Summary
/// Creates a Child VASP account with its parent being the sending account of the transaction.
/// The sender of the transaction must be a Parent VASP account.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// Creates a `ChildVASP` account for the sender `parent_vasp` at `child_address` with a balance of
/// `child_initial_balance` in `CoinType` and an initial authentication key of
/// `auth_key_prefix | child_address`.
///
/// If `add_all_currencies` is true, the child address will have a zero balance in all available
/// currencies in the system.
///
/// The new account will be a child account of the transaction sender, which must be a
/// Parent VASP account. The child account will be recorded against the limit of
/// child accounts of the creating Parent VASP account.
///
/// ## Events
/// Successful execution with a `child_initial_balance` greater than zero will emit:
/// * A `DiemAccount::SentPaymentEvent` with the `payer` field being the Parent VASP's address,
/// and payee field being `child_address`. This is emitted on the Parent VASP's
/// `DiemAccount::DiemAccount` `sent_events` handle.
/// * A `DiemAccount::ReceivedPaymentEvent` with the  `payer` field being the Parent VASP's address,
/// and payee field being `child_address`. This is emitted on the new Child VASPS's
/// `DiemAccount::DiemAccount` `received_events` handle.
