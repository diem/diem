Bitcoin Core version 0.9.2 is now available from:

  https://bitcoin.org/bin/0.9.2/

This is a new minor version release, bringing mostly bug fixes and some minor
improvements. OpenSSL has been updated because of a security issue (CVE-2014-0224).
Upgrading to this release is recommended.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or
bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you run
0.9.2 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take anywhere from 
30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of your machine.

Downgrading warnings
--------------------

The 'chainstate' for this release is not always compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.9.x and then decide to switch back to a
0.8.x release you might get a blockchain validation error when starting the
old release (due to 'pruned outputs' being omitted from the index of
unspent transaction outputs).

Running the old release with the -reindex option will rebuild the chainstate
data structures and correct the problem.

Also, the first time you run a 0.8.x release on a 0.9 wallet it will rescan
the blockchain for missing spent coins, which will take a long time (tens
of minutes on a typical machine).

Important changes
==================

Gitian OSX build
-----------------

The deterministic build system that was already used for Windows and Linux
builds is now used for OSX as well. Although the resulting executables have
been tested quite a bit, there could be possible regressions. Be sure to report
these on the Github bug tracker mentioned above.

Compatibility of Linux build
-----------------------------

For Linux we now build against Qt 4.6, and filter the symbols for libstdc++ and glibc.
This brings back compatibility with

- Debian 6+ / Tails
- Ubuntu 10.04
- CentOS 6.5
