Bitcoin-Qt version 0.8.2 is now available from:
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.8.2/

This is a maintenance release that fixes many bugs and includes
a few small new features.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues


How to Upgrade

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait
until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older
versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over
/Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or bitcoind/bitcoin-qt (on Linux).

If you are upgrading from version 0.7.2 or earlier, the first time you
run 0.8.2 your blockchain files will be re-indexed, which will take
anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours, depending on the speed of
your machine.

0.8.2 Release notes

Fee Policy changes

The default fee for low-priority transactions is lowered from 0.0005 BTC 
(for each 1,000 bytes in the transaction; an average transaction is
about 500 bytes) to 0.0001 BTC.

Payments (transaction outputs) of 0.543 times the minimum relay fee
(0.00005430 BTC) are now considered 'non-standard', because storing them
costs the network more than they are worth and spending them will usually
cost their owner more in transaction fees than they are worth.

Non-standard transactions are not relayed across the network, are not included
in blocks by most miners, and will not show up in your wallet until they are
included in a block.

The default fee policy can be overridden using the -mintxfee and -minrelaytxfee
command-line options, but note that we intend to replace the hard-coded fees
with code that automatically calculates and suggests appropriate fees in the
0.9 release and note that if you set a fee policy significantly different from
the rest of the network your transactions may never confirm.

* -alertnotify will call a command on receiving an alert from the network.
* -par now takes a negative number, to leave a certain amount of cores free.

JSON-RPC API changes

* fixed a getblocktemplate bug that caused excessive CPU creating blocks.
* listunspent now lists account and address information.
* getinfo now also returns the time adjustment estimated from your peers.
* getpeerinfo now returns bytessent, bytesrecv and syncnode.
* gettxoutsetinfo returns statistics about the unspent transaction output database.
* gettxout returns information about a specific unspent transaction output.


Networking changes

* Significant changes to the networking code, reducing latency and memory consumption.
* Avoid initial block download stalling.
* Remove IRC seeding support.
* Performance tweaks.

Wallet compatibility/rescuing

Known Bugs
