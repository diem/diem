Controlling dependencies
------------------------
Some dependencies are not needed in all configurations. The following are some factors that affect the dependency list.

#### Options passed to `./configure`
* MiniUPnPc is not needed with  `--with-miniupnpc=no`.
* Berkeley DB is not needed with `--disable-wallet`.
* protobuf is not needed with `--disable-bip70`.
* Qt is not needed with `--without-gui`.
* If the qrencode dependency is absent, QR support won't be added. To force an error when that happens, pass `--with-qrencode`.
* ZeroMQ is needed only with the `--with-zmq` option.

#### Other
* librsvg is only needed if you need to run `make deploy` on (cross-compilation to) macOS.
