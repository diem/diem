A user of this should check that the data returned matches what they expect.  As an example, a potential attack vector would be something like the following: Alice is buying an apple from Bob. Alice's phone signs a transaction X with sequence number N that pays coins to Bob. Alice transmits this signature to Bob's payment terminal which then submits the transaction and checks its status to see if Alice can be given the apple. However, as Bob is doing this Alice constructs a second transaction X' also with sequence number N. Alice gets that transaction inserted in the blockchain. If Bob isn't thoughtful about how he uses this API he may assume that if he asks for the N'th transaction on Alice's account that when the API returns that this means the transaction has gone through.

Runtime Statuses: errors that can arise from the execution of a    transaction (assuming the prologue executes without error).
