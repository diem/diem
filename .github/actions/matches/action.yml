name: "File Matching"
description: |
  Match the contents of a file against a glob to determine if any changes are relevant to a build.
inputs:
  changes-file:
    description: |
      Full path of file containing a list of files relative to the root of the git repository that has been modified.
      If not specified then an environment variable named $CHANGES_CHANGED_FILE_OUTPUTFILE will be used as supplied by the
      changes github action.  Should no file be set, by the environment variable or the parameter, then lacking any
      knowledge of what might have changed, this action assumes changes were made.
