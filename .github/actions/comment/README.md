# comment

This action adds a comment to an issue or pull request. The issue or pull
request is implied by where the action is triggered. It can also tag the
comments and remove older instances of comments with the same tag.

## Usage

Here's an example workflow using this action:

```yaml
  comment-on-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: comment on issue
    steps:
      - name: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: post comment
        uses: ./.github/actions/comment
        with:
          comment: "this is a comment"
```

## Inputs

### `comment`

The comment text. If this is blank, no new comment will be added, but
`delete-older` can still be used.

### `tag`

A string tag that will be added to the hidden metadata of the
comment. Defaults to "unknown".

Since all comments come from the `github-actions` user, this allows workflows
to distinguish specific comments if needed, for example, when using
`delete-older`.

### `delete-older`

If set to true, older comments with the same tag will be deleted before a new
comment is posted. This can be used to make the workflow less chatty.
