### Payment payout
This action simulates the conversion of Diem Coins into a fiat currency and the transfer to the merchant's bank account. The action focuses on demonstrating the actions involving Diem Coins and doesnâ€™t perform any actual fiat transfers.

### Payment refund
This action simulates refunding a cleared payment. The action creates a transaction sending the paid Diem Coins back to the wallet that originally sent the payment.
