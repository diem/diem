This guide describes how to use the Diem command line interface (CLI) client to interact with the Diem Blockchain’s testnet. The CLI is invoked as an interactive shell. It provides basic commands to simulate the creation of accounts, the minting of Diem Coins, performing transfers, and querying the blockchain. You can use the CLI client to interact with a validator node in different types of networks such as testnet, a local test validator network, or on a remote blockchain by specifying the node's hostname.

You can also try out our [interactive Diem CLI tutorial](/docs/cli). It's a fully functioning terminal connected to the Diem testnet.

## Invoke the Diem CLI client
There are two ways to invoke the Diem CLI client:
* Connect to testnet via the CLI client
* Run a CLI client to connect to any Diem network


### Connect to the Testnet via the CLI Client
To connect to the testnet through the CLI, a convenience script can be used to invoke the CLI without needing to specify parameters.  To invoke this, change to the `diem` directory and run:

```bash
./scripts/cli/start_cli_testnet.sh
```


### Run a CLI Client to Connect to Any Diem Network
To invoke the CLI client and configure it yourself, run:

```bash
cargo run -p cli --bin cli -- [OPTIONS] --host <host> --validator_set_file <validator_set_file>
```

#### Options

The options for running the CLI client command to connect to any Dien network are:

|Command | Description|
|----- |----- |
| `-c | --chain-id`| Chain ID of the network this client is connecting to|
|`-m | --faucet_key_file_path` |Path to the generated key-pair for the faucet account. The faucet account can be used to simulate the minting of fake Diem Coins. If not passed, a new key-pair will be generated for you and placed in a temporary directory. To manually generate a keypair, use generate_keypair: `cargo run -p generate_keypair -- -o <output_file_path>`. |
|`-f | --faucet-url` |The full URL of the host that operates a faucet service. If not passed, this will be derived from the URL parameter under the strict assumption that the URL parameter is under the (sub)domain name `client` and the corresponding faucet service is under the (sub)domain name `faucet`. |
| `-u | —-url` | The full URL of the destination host for the CLI to connect to. If applicable, this should include the port number of the host’s JSON RPC server. |
| `-n | --mnemonic_file` | The file location from which to load the mnemonic word for user account address/key generation. If not passed, a new mnemonic file is generated by diem_wallet in the current directory.|
| `-r | --sync` | If set, the client will sync with the connected node during wallet recovery. |
|`--waypoint` | If set, the client will use the waypoint parameter for its initial LedgerInfo verification.|
|`--waypoint_url`| The URL to retrieve the waypoint from, if the waypoint parameter is not passed. |
| `--verbose` | If set, the client will produce verbose output. |



## Commands

Once started with any of the three commands previously mentioned, the following CLI commands are available:

```plaintext
major_command subcommand [options]
```

If you enter only the major command, it will show the help information for that command. Major commands can be any one of the following:

---

 #### `account | a` &mdash;  Account related operations. Subcommands include:

  `create | c` &mdash;  Create a random account with private/public key pair. Account information will be held in memory only. The created account will not be saved to the chain. Returns reference ID to use in other operations.

      Usage:
          create|c

  `list | la` &mdash; Print all accounts that were created or loaded.

      Usage:
          list|la

  `recover | r` &mdash; Recover all accounts that were written to a file via the `account write` command.

      Usage:
          recover|r <file_path>
      Arguments:
          file_path - File path from which to load mnemonic recover seed.  Must have been written via `account write`.

  `write | w` &mdash; Save Diem wallet mnemonic recovery seed to disk.  This will allow accounts to be recovered via `account recover`.

      Usage:
          write|w <file_path>
      Arguments:
          file_path - File path at which to save the mnemonic recovery seed to disk.

  `<mint | m> | <mintb | mb>` &mdash; Mint coins to the account. Creates an account at the recipient address if one does not already exist. Suffix 'b' is for blocking. If blocking is specified (using suffix 'b'), CLI will query chain until the transaction is finalized/available. Same is true for other sub "blocking" commands.

      Usage:
          mint|mint|m|b <receiver_account_ref_id>|<receiver_account_address> <number_of_coins> <currency_code> [use_base_units (default=false)]
      Arguments:
          receiver_account_ref_id | receiver_account_address - The receiver account to mint the coins to.
                If the receiver account does not exist, it will be created first.
                Either receiver_account_address or receiver_account_ref_id (an internal index of
                the account in the CLI client) can be used to specify receiver account (as in
                other commands). If gas is being charged, the account that sent this mint transaction
                (currently preloaded genesis account) pays for the gas.
          number_of_coins - The number of coins to be minted to the receiver account.
          currency_code - Which currency to mint. For example, `XUS`.

`<addc | ac> | <addcb | acb>` &mdash; Add specified currency to the account. Suffix 'b' is for blocking.

      Usage:
          addc|addcb|ac|acb <account_address> <currency_code>
      Arguments:
          account_address - The account to add the currency to.
          currency_code - Which currency to add. For example, `Coin2`.

---

#### `<transfer | t> | <transferb | tb>` &mdash; Transfer coins from one account to another. Suffix 'b' is for blocking.

      Usage:
          transfer|transferb|t|tb <sender_account_address>|<sender_account_ref_id> <receiver_account_address>|<receiver_account_ref_id> <number_of_coins> <currency_code> [gas_unit_price_in_micro_diems (default=0)] [max_gas_amount_in_micro_diems (default 10000)]
      Arguments:
          sender_account_address|sender_account_ref_id - The account from which this transfer transaction
                is sent. The sender account pays for the gas.
          receive_account_address|receiver_account_ref_id - The account to which this transaction sends coins.
                If the receiver account does not exist, it will be created first. The sender will pay for
                gas required for both account creation and coin transfer.
          number_of_coins - The number of coins transferred to receiver account.
          currency_code - Which currency to transfer. For example, `XUS`.
          gas_unit_price_in_micro_diems - The unit price to pay for gas.
          max_gas_amount_in_micro_diems - Max units of gas user is willing to pay for this transaction.

---

#### `query | q` &mdash; Query data from destination chain. All query operations are blocking. Subcommands include:

      Usage:
          balance|b <account_ref_id>|<account_address>
      Arguments:
          account_ref_id|account_address - The account to query balance for.

          reset_sequence_number - If the sequence number known locally by the CLI differs from the
                value known on chain, this will reset the local sequence number to to on-chain
                value.  This is useful when a user encounters an invalid sequence number error.

### Account Creation/Minting (Faucet) for Testnet

Account creation provided by the CLI generates a local keypair, but nothing is created on the testnet blockchain. To create an account on tesnet:

* Transfer fake Diem Coins to the address you wish to create. If the recipient account does not exist, you must create the recipient account first, and then add the specific currency into the account in order for it to receive fake Diem Coins. The sender pays a transaction fee (gas) for both account creation and transfer.
* Send a mint transaction to simulate the minting of Diem Coins to an account. If the account does not exist, the account will be created first and the fake Diem Coins will be minted later. Unlike other transactions, a nonexistent account itself can request a simulated mint transaction.
