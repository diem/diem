This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Diem project.

> **Note**: As Diem Core is currently in the prototype stage and does not power a blockchain with a cryptocurrency that has real-world value, our security procedures are not fully in place. We will release a more complete disclosure policy prior to the launch of the mainnet.

## Reporting a Bug

The Diem team and community take all security bugs in the Diem project
seriously to ensure the security of the Diem Blockchain.

You can also report security bugs by emailing us directly at [security@diem.com](mailto:security@diem.com).

Thank you for improving the security of the Diem Blockchain! Your efforts and responsible disclosure are appreciated, and every effort will be made to acknowledge your contributions in a timely manner.
