The Diem Reference Merchant project demonstrates the possible integration of Diem payments on an online shopping website. This project is meant to be a reference you can use while building your own merchant solution.

## Introduction

You can demo the following concepts using this reference project:

* Integration of a Diem payment solution in a pre-existing website without exposing the merchant to Diem Coins or any Diem Blockchain specifics.
* Conceptual implementation of a [Regulated VASP](../reference/glossary#regulated-vasp)) service providing such Diem integration to merchants.
* Support for Diem payments with web and mobile wallets.


## Architecture

The Diem Reference Merchant project demonstrates three main entities that would be separate in most real world scenarios: a merchant, a Regulated VASP, and a liquidity provider.

As illustrated above, this project is a collection of the following interconnected entities:

* Online Merchant: This is a demo web shop accepting Diem payments for the items it sells. It is composed of front-end, back-end, and database services.
* Regulated Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP): This entity provides payment clearance, fiat pay-out, and refund services to the merchant. It is composed of back-end and database services.
* Liquidity Provider: This service converts (for the Regulated VASP) Diem Coin currencies to and from fiat currencies.
* Gateway: This entity manages the network traffic between the outside world and the merchant solution services.
