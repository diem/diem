`signer` is a built-in Move resource type. A `signer` is a [capability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-capability_model) that allows the holder to act on behalf of a particular `address`. You can think of the native implementation as being:

```rust
resource struct signer { a: address }
```

A `signer` is somewhat similar to a Unix [UID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_identifier) in that it represents a user authenticated by code *outside* of Move (e.g., by checking a cryptographic signature or password).

## Comparison to `address`

A Move program can create any `address` value without special permission using address literals:

```rust
let a1 = 0x1;
let a2 = 0x2;
// ... and so on for every other possible address
```

However, `signer` values are special because they cannot be created via literals or instructions--only by the Move VM. Before the VM runs a script with parameters of type `&signer`, it will automatically create `signer` values and pass them into the script:

```rust=
script {
    use 0x1::Signer;
    fun main(s: signer) {
        assert(Signer::address_of(&s) == 0x42, 0);
    }
}
```

This script will abort with code `0` if the script is sent from any address other than `0x42`.

A transaction script can have an arbitrary number of `signer`s as long as the signers are a prefix to any other arguments. In other words, all of the signer arguments must come first:

```rust=
script {
    use 0x1::Signer;
    fun main(s1: signer, s2: signer, x: u64, y: u8) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

This is useful for implementing *multi-signer scripts* that atomically act with the authority of multiple parties. For example, an extension of the script above could perform an atomic currency swap between `s1` and `s2`.


## `signer` Operators

The `0x1::Signer` standard library module provides two utility functions over `signer` values:

| Function | Description
| ---------- | ----------
| `Signer::address_of(&signer): address` | Return the `address` wrapped by this `&signer`.
| `Signer::borrow_address(&signer): &address` | Return a reference to the `address` wrapped by this `&signer`


In addition, the `move_to<T>(&signer, T)` [global storage operator](/docs/move/move-global-storage/move-global-storage-operators) requires a `&signer` argument to publish a resource `T` under `signer.address`'s account. This ensures that only an authenticated user can elect to publish a resource under their `address`.
