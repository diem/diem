//! This module provides algorithms for accessing and updating a Merkle Accumulator structure
//! persisted in a key-value store. Note that this doesn't write to the storage directly, rather,
//! it reads from it via the `HashReader` trait and yields writes via an in memory `HashMap`.
//!
//! # Merkle Accumulator
//! Given an ever growing (append only) series of "leaf" hashes, we construct an evolving Merkle
//! Tree for which proofs of inclusion/exclusion of a leaf hash at a leaf index in a snapshot
//! of the tree (represented by root hash) can be given.
//!
//! # Leaf Nodes
//! Leaf nodes carry hash values to be stored and proved. They are only appended to the tree but
//! never deleted or updated.
//!
//! # Internal Nodes
//! A non-leaf node carries the hash value derived from both its left and right children.
//!
//! # Placeholder Nodes
//! To make sure each Leaf node has a Merkle Proof towards the root, placeholder nodes are added so
//! that along the route from a leaf to the root, each node has a sibling. Placeholder nodes have
//! the hash value `ACCUMULATOR_PLACEHOLDER_HASH`
//!
//! A placeholder node can appear as either a Leaf node or a non-Leaf node, but there is at most one
//! placeholder leaf at any time.
//!
//! # Frozen Nodes & Non-frozen Nodes
//! As leaves are added to the tree, placeholder nodes get replaced by non-placeholder nodes, and
//! when a node has all its descendants being non-placeholder, it becomes "Frozen" -- its hash value
//! won't change again in the event of new leaves being added. All leaves appended (not counting the
//! one possible placeholder leaf) are by definition Frozen.
//!
//! Other nodes, which have one or more placeholder descendants are Non-Frozen. As new elements are
//! appended to the accumulator the hash value of these nodes will change.
//!
//! # Leaf Count
//! Given a count of the number of leaves in a Merkle Accumulator it is possible to determine the
//! shape of the accumulator -- which nodes are filled and which nodes are placeholder nodes.
//!
//! Example:
//! Logical view of a Merkle Accumulator with 5 leaves:
//! ```text
//!            Non-fzn
//!           /       \
//!          /         \
//!         /           \
//!       Fzn2         Non-fzn
//!      /   \           /   \
//!     /     \         /     \
//!    Fzn1    Fzn3  Non-fzn  [Placeholder]
//!   /  \    /  \    /    \
//!  L0  L1  L2  L3 L4   [Placeholder]
//! ```
//!
//! # Position and Physical Representation
//! As a Merkle Accumulator tree expands to the right and upwards, we number newly frozen nodes
//! monotonically. One way to do it is simply to use in-order index of nodes, and this is what
//! we do for the in-memory representation. We call the stated numbers identifying nodes below
//! simply "Position", and unless otherwise stated, this is the in-order position.
//!
//! For writing to disk however, we write all the children of a node before the parent.
//! Thus for disk write order, it is more convenient to use the post-order position as an index.
//! And with that we can map a Merkle Accumulator into a key-value storage: key is the post-order
//! position of a node, and the value is hash value it carries.
//!
//! We store only Frozen nodes, and generate non-Frozen nodes on the fly when accessing the tree.
//! This way, the physical representation of the tree is append-only, i.e. once written to physical
//! storage, nodes won't be either modified or deleted.
//!
//! Here is what we persist for the logical tree in the above example:
//!
//! ```text
//!          Fzn2(6)
//!         /      \
//!        /        \
//!    Fzn1(2)       Fzn3(5)
//!   /     \       /     \
//!  L0(0)  L1(1)  L2(3)  L3(4)  L4(7)
//! ```
//!
//! When the next leaf node is persisted, the physical representation will be:
//!
//! ```text
//!          Fzn2(6)
//!         /      \
//!        /        \
//!    Fzn1(2)       Fzn3(5)       Fzn4(9)
//!   /     \       /     \       /      \
//!  L0(0)  L1(1)  L2(3)  L3(4)  L4(7)   L5(8)
//! ```
//!
//! The numbering corresponds to the post-order traversal of the tree.
//!
//! To think in key-value pairs:
//! ```text
//! |<-key->|<--value-->|
//! |   0   | hash_L0   |
//! |   1   | hash_L1   |
//! |   2   | hash_Fzn1 |
//! |  ...  |   ...     |
//! ```
